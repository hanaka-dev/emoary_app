## ✨ Overview
**emoary** is a well‑being web app that helps people **notice** their emotions and **look back** on patterns over time.
- **Fast entry**: pick an emotion and adjust a slider
- **Optional depth**: jot a short memo or (future) talk with a conversational AI to explore causes.
- **Gentle by design**: useful but never pushy; built around *continuity* and *self‑awareness*.

> This repository currently contains early design assets (requirements, mockups, logo/icon) and the first implementation steps.

## 🧭 Core principles
- **Easy to continue** — minimal input first; no cognitive overload.
- **Staged depth** — start light, go deeper only when helpful.
- **User autonomy** — keep interventions supportive, not intrusive.
- **Reflection matters** — turn logs into insights and small actions.

## 🧩 Features (MVP & beyond)
**MVP**
- Emotion selection + **intensity slider**
- **Quick note** (optional)
- **Timeline / simple trends** for reflection
- Account / auth (personal diary stays yours)

**Planned / Next**
- **Conversational AI counselor** (cause exploration, gentle prompts)
- “**Emotion tree**” that grows with journaling frequency
- Reminders, custom emotions, integrations (calendar / SNS)
- Multi‑language support

## 🧪 Design notes
Through iterative builds, I am testing the balance between **user autonomy** and **app interventions** to support
**sustained engagement** without pressure. Small hypothesis → tweak UI copy/layout → observe → refine.

## 🛡 Ethics & Privacy
- Private by default; your diary is yours.
- Minimal collection; clear purpose and control.
- Supportive language; no shaming or coercive nudges.
